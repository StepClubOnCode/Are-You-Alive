# Are You Alive?
### Task:
  Edit the `Status.txt` file, replace the `___` inside the file with your answer.
  This task is to get you used to the workflow.

## Workflow:
### Submitting:
  In every upcoming task, there will be a file (also called a "script") called `Submit.sh`, think of this like a `.exe` <br>
You don't have to worry about what's inside of this script. Just know that you need to run this file.
##### How to submit:
* Press Ctrl + Tilde (`) to bring up the terminal. It should be the bottom panel that's opened by default.<br> PS: The terminal will have a blinking cursor.
* Finally, Type `./Submit.sh`

You can submit multiple times, everytime you submit, it will add your current code to the version history.

### Learn more:
  I try to detail how everything works to the best that I can do.
For example, Inside of `Submit.sh`, I've written comments. <br>
Hint: Comments start with `#` <br>
